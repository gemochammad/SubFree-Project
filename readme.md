**SubFree** is a free and simple subdomain service inspired by [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev), designed for developers, creators, and builders who want custom subdomains — without touching complex code, repos, or GitHub forks. Just request a subdomain through the web app, and it’s automatically managed through Cloudflare. Fast, secure, and stress-free.
